# Flat File (CSV)

The CSV connector is capable of reading from- and writing to character
separated text files. the module supports import and export operations.

The file should contain columns separated by the ***Column separator***
parameter. A ***Text qualifier*** can be set in order for IBIS to
recognize the text portion of a column.

If the data in a colum contains the text qualifier itself (for example,
the text qualifier is **‘**, en the data is **Dhr. A in 't Veld**), the
qualifier should be escaped by duplicating it (**Dhr. A in 't Veld**).

In general this is ‘cn’, but some object types require a different naming attribute                                                                                                    |
|     Managed containers     |     X    | A list of containers that are managed by this connector, one per line. Objects outside of this containers will not be touched. It is also not possible to create new objects in containers that are not in this list.   The containers must be formatted using their full distinguished name.   For example:   ou=staff,ou=users,ou=iam,o=org   ou=factory,ou=users,ou=iam,o=org |
