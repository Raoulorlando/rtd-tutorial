## Special properties

### \_photo

Photos are stored as separate objects in SuccessFactors. Since the
connector only supports 1 on 1 relations, the connector will query
SuccessFactors for the user photo with the name specified in the
connector settings and add it to the \_**photo** property of the user.

On export, the \_**photo** property will be downsized to 180\*240 and
added/updated in SuccessFactors. When the \_photo property is cleared
and a photo with *\[Photo name\]* exists in SuccessFactors it will be
deleted.

### \_ibisEmploymentTypeMainGroup

Contains the converted value of EmployeeClass using configuration
parameter **Employee class mappings**

### \_ibisEmploymentTypeSubGroup

Contains the converted value of EmploymentType using configuration
parameter **Employment type mappings**

### \_phone\_home

Contains the phone number where phoneType == **SAP ID private phone**

### \_phone\_home\_mobile

Contains the phone number where phoneType == **SAP ID private mobile

### \_phone\_work
