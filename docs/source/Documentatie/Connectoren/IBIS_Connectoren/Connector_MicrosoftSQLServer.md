# Microsoft SQL Connector

The SQL-module communicates with a Microsoft SQL Server table or view.

-   In order to update a view, it must not span multiple tables.
-   Export is only supported when a primary key column is used, not when
    using a primary key expression.

## Primary key

The primary key for objects delivered by this module is defined in the
***Key column*** or the ***Primary key expression*** parameter in the
module settings.
