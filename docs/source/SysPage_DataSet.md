##### DataSets

Documentation and examples for the use of datasets, in combination with
dynamic fields, workflows and more.

#### Use of datasets

A dataset is a (partial) collection of data, which is created based on
specified criteria. This can then be used in other parts of IBIS.

#### Dynamic property criteria

Datasets can also use dynamic properties. Examples of data types and
their examples:

String  
DynamicProperties\["PropertyName"\] == "stringvalue"

Boolean  
DynamicProperties\["PropertyName"\] == "True"

Int32  
DynamicProperties\["PropertyName"\] == "123"

DateTime  
DynamicProperties\["PropertyName"\] == """2023-11-13T00:00:00"""
