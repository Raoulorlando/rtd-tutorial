- New dropdown list component applied to various screens to enable better filtering.

- The Audit page now also displays the Object type information in the overlay.
- Connector:
  - The request body for the SCIM connector has been further expanded.
  - TOPdesk connector has been expanded for importing Assets (CMDB).
- Entitlement management:
  - For a resource, it is now possible to configure a separate Condition group operator for:
    - Rules for automatic assignment
    - Rules for manual assignment
    - Rules for approval
  - The start date and end date validations for Resource requests and allocations have been optimized for:
    - Manual requests
    - Open requests
    - Changes in the (target) registrations
    - Allocations
  - It is now possible to specify a start and end date per resource for automatically created requests in ABAC. The mapping of the start and end date properties can be done in the IBIS settings > ABAC > TreeManager relations.
  - In a resource, the 'Path' dropdown list has been renamed to 'Map', and you can now also view/use the tree structure.
- A background task is available for managing identity registration for situations where an employee registration has expired or a new one is starting.
- The 'Country of Birth' field is now a dropdown list instead of an input field.
- The fields 'Nationality' and 'Second nationality' can now use the Countries table in the setup.
- Various usability improvements have been implemented.
- Various API performance improvements have been implemented.
- License:
  - /license screens have been removed in Treemanager and ABAC. Instead, a license check is performed when a certain action is performed requiring TM or ABAC. License management for IBIS, Treemanager, and ABAC can be found in IBIS on the /licensing page.
  - Treemanager:
    - If you create a new tree in TreeDesigner and you do not have a license, no tree will be created. Nothing happens with existing trees.
    - Notifications for invalid TM licenses are shown in TM logging.
    - To resolve a TM license issue, you can press the 'Update TreeManager license' button on the IBIS /licensing page.
    - TreeManager\App_Data\license.lic is then created/updated.
    - IBIS does not indicate whether a TM license is valid or invalid.
  - ABAC:
    - If the ABAC background task 'Worker' starts running and there is no valid license, the worker will not perform its tasks.
    - Notifications for invalid ABAC licenses are shown in ABAC logging.
    - To resolve an ABAC license issue, you can press the 'Update ABAC license' button on the IBIS /licensing page.
    - ABAC\App_Data\license.lic is then created/updated.
    - IBIS does not indicate whether an ABAC license is valid or invalid.
- Conflict policy:
  - If there is an active blockade of a resource for a specific employee, this will be mentioned to the requester during the (manual) request process. This prevents unnecessary requests that will be blocked again.

**Resolved Bugs**:
  - The argument name is shown instead of the display name in the action buttons.
  - ABAC memory usage is not optimal.
  - Clicking on the job description field in the employee registration page before selecting an organization displays an error in the log.
  - ABAC connector indicates that it is still running in the task history even when there are no hangfire tasks.
  - Deleted Target loaders columns are shown again after being deleted.
  - MemberOf is not available in the AD connector schema.
